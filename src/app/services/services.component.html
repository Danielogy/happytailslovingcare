        <strong>Meet & Greet</strong><br><br>
        This is the initial meeting where everyone gets acquainted, and we discuss your needs and my services. Here, I will meet
        and get to know your pet, learn your pet’s routine and see where items are located. I will also answer any questions you
        may have. At the meet, I will require 1 set of house keys and a deposit. The meet and greet usually takes about 30
        minutes, depending on how many pets you have.
